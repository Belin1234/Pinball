# {Pokemon Pinball GBC 1999}

## Description

This is a Physics 2 class project of the CITM UPC video game design and development degree. In this project we have emulated the 1999 Pokemon Pinball game for the Game Boy Color. Originally in the GBC console to have two screens the game simulated two scenarios, in this emulation that we have created we have joined the two screens to play comfortably in the same scene.

## Key Features

 - Flippers using revolute joints
 - Spring using a spring joint
 - Voltorbs as collisions with impulse
 - Triangles as collisions with impulse
 - Pikachu teleporting with a collision impulse
 - Digletts with a combo that if you hit the same diglett 3 times then it gives you a bonus for the combo
 - Ditto movement with a sensor
 - Little sensors which each one gives you 100 points
 - Recharge system with a Bellsprout impulse ability (unfinished)
 - Score, lives and fps
 - Music and audio effects

Due to lack of time, unexpected bugs and complications the project has been completed with a small bug and unfinished functionality. Basically when the lives of your game reach 0, a message will appear to inform the player that if he presses the R key he will be able to restart the game. The error that we commented appears in this case, when the lives reach 0 a pokeball reappears in the spawn of the dock. If the player instead of pressing the R key to restart the game presses the down arrow to push the pokeball, it will create a bug. He will not be able to restart when he loses that pokeball.

We understand how we can fix this bug, we would have liked to have the time to fix it and be able to deliver a finished project, although we are very satisfied with the work done. 

Regarding the unfinished functionality, it is about the Bellsprout plant, the skill recharge system. The Bellsprout was originally supposed to recharge, swallow the ball and spit it out, awarding the player score. We have managed to make the reloading system progress, and once filled next to the sensor in the Bellsprout's mouth, the collision we were looking for appeared to push the pokeball down. But when the collision of the mouth was deleted, the system did not return to the beginning, so the energy remained recharged to the maximum.

Once again we are very satisfied with the work done, we have overcome obstacles and doubts that have arisen along the way, we know that with a little more time we could have done a magnificent job.
